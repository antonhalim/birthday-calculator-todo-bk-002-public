# Birthday Calculator

## Objective

Gain familiarity with Ruby's Date class and understand how to manipulate Date objects.

## Instructions
* This is a test-driven todo so just run these commands and get those tests to pass:
  * bundle install
  * rspec
* To be able to test your code, the todo uses the [Timecop gem](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop) to "freeze" time, including Time.now and Date.today, at July 14, 2014. You can see where it's configured in the config block in `spec_helper`.

## Resources 
* [RubyDocs](http://ruby-doc.org/) - [Parsing Date Objects](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html#method-c-parse)
* [RubyDocs](http://ruby-doc.org/) - [Date](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - [Timecop gem](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop)
